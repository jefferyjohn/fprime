## autocoder/autocoder.cmake:

Autocoder setup and support file. This performs all of the general autocoder functions, running the specific functions
defined within the individual autocoders. This gives the ability to run a set of autocoders to produce files.

Note: autocoders need to be run by targets. See target/target.cmake.


## run_ac_set:

Run a set of autocoder allowing back-to-back execution of a set of autocoders. SOURCES are the source files that are
input into the autocoder filters.  Extra arguments may be an include path for an autocoder (e.g. autocoder/fpp) or can
be INFO_ONLY to mark the next autocoder as only generating info.

SOURCES: source file input list
...: autocoder include or INFO_ONLY


## __memoize:

This take two "long" processing steps of the autocoder that run during the configuration step of CMake and notes the
output such that the results are cached and repeated unless the input file has changed since the last pass through
this function. This is done for efficiency when the generate dependencies or generate files step takes a large
execution costs.

Note: cached variables are the following: GENERATED_FILES, MODULE_DEPENDENCIES, FILE_DEPENDENCIES

SOURCES: source file that is being parsed and must have changed for a recalculation


## run_ac:

Run the autocoder across the set of source files, SOURCES, and the previously generated sources, GENERATED_SOURCES.
This will filter the SOURCES and GENERATED_SOURCES down to the handled set. Then for single-input autocoders, it runs
the autocoder one input at a time, otherwise it runs the autocoder once on all inputs.

AUTOCODER_CMAKE: cmake file containing autocoder definition
SOURCES: sources input to run on the autocoder
GENERATED_SOURCES: sources created by other autocoders
INFO_ONLY: TRUE if only information is needed, FALSE to run otherwise


## _filter_sources:

Filters sources down to the ones supported by the active autocoder. It is an error to call this helper function before
including an autocoder's CMake file and thus setting the active autocoder. Helper function.

OUTPUT_NAME: name of output variable to set in parent scope
...: any number of arguments containing lists of sources


## __ac_process_sources:

Process sources found in SOURCES list.  If INFO_ONLY is set, then the autocoder is not setup, but rather only the
dependency and file information is generated. Otherwise, the autocoder is setup to run on sources. Helper function.

SOURCES: source file list. Note: if the autocoder sets HANDLES_INDIVIDUAL_SOURCES this will be singular
INFO_ONLY: TRUE if only information is to be generated FALSE (normal) to setup autocoding rules
